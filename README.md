I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in *Computer Science and Engineering* at Politecnico di Milano. Over the last few years, I have dedicated my time to learn everything I could about **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**, working on some projects. Now I am looking forward to find the opportunity to apply my skills in a stimulating environment. In particular I am looking for a research project to work on for my thesis, to further extend my knowledge in my study field. 

### My path in computer science

* :books: as long as I can remember I love problem solving
* :writing_hand: mathematical and physics olympiads streghtend my interest in problem solving
* :computer: I fell in love with computer science during high school, I was intrigued by its limitless applications
* :de: at the end of my first year at University of Pisa, I did an internship at Max Planck for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart working on object detection
* :mechanical_arm: during my third year at University of Pisa, I did an internship at the Biorobotic Institute of Sant'Anna School of advanced studies working on I-Support Horizon 2020 project involving a robotic arm
* :hearts: I fell in love with Deep Learning after working at my  after working on achelor thesis on **Text generation with Deep Neural Networks** 
* :airplane: I moved to Milan and started studying at Politecnico di Milano, focusing on **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**

### About me

* :film_projector: Ex tv series addicted, Breaking Bad is my all time favourite
